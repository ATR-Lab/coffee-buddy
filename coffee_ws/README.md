Commands to launch all of the nodes:

```
source ../ros-source.sh
colcon build
ros-source
ros2 launch coffee_head all_nodes.launch.py
```

- Camera node handles opening the camera, tracking faces (`src/coffee_head/coffee_head/camera_node.py`).
- Head tracking handles the PID controller, and is in coordination with the camera node to move the motors to center the detected face in frame (`src/coffee_head/coffee_head/head_tracking.py`).
  - Subscribes to the camera node.
- Coffee Expression show the latest version of the eye shapes with a new topic message (`src/coffee_expressions/coffee_expressions/plaipin_expressive_eyes.py`)
- Coffee Eyes shows the eye visuals for the Coffee Buddy robot,  (`src/coffee_face/coffee_face/coffee_eyes.py`).
  - Subscribes to the camera node to adjust eye position in window.

Commands to launch separate nodes:

```
source ../ros-source.sh
colcon build
ros-source
ros2 run coffee_head camera_node
ros2 run coffee_head head_tracking
ros2 run coffee_head eye_tracking
ros2 run coffee_expressions plaipin_expressive_eyes
ros2 run coffee_face coffee_eyes
ros2 run coffee_expressions_test_ui expressions_test_ui
```

**NOTE:** We define the location of `expressions.json` in the `setup.py` file inside `coffee_expressions` directory.
