# ros_source.sh - Intelligent ROS2 environment sourcing utility
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script provides an intelligent way to source ROS2 environments without
#   hardcoding paths or ROS versions. It automatically detects the installed ROS
#   distribution and finds the nearest workspace by searching upward from the
#   current directory.
#
#   This eliminates the need to manually source multiple setup files and makes
#   the environment setup portable across different ROS installations and
#   workspace structures.
#
# FEATURES:
#   - Auto-detects ROS version (jazzy, humble, iron, etc.)
#   - Searches upward for workspace (no need to be in specific directory)
#   - Handles missing ROS installations gracefully
#   - Provides clear feedback about what's being sourced
#   - Returns appropriate exit codes for error handling
#
# USAGE:
#   # Load the function (usually done by other scripts)
#   source ros_source.sh
#   
#   # Call the function to set up environment
#   ros-source
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Manual usage
#   cd ~/my_project/coffee_ws/src/my_package
#   source ../../../scripts/ros_source.sh
#   ros-source  # Will find and source coffee_ws workspace
#
#   # Used by other scripts
#   source "$SCRIPTS_PATH/ros_source.sh"
#   ros-source
#
# RETURN CODES:
#   0 - Success (ROS and workspace sourced)
#   1 - Error (ROS not found or workspace not found)
#
# WHAT IT SOURCES:
#   1. Global ROS setup: /opt/ros/{version}/setup.bash
#   2. Workspace setup: {workspace}/install/setup.bash (if found)
#
# DIRECTORY SEARCH:
#   Searches upward from current directory until it finds install/setup.bash
#   Example: /home/user/project/workspace/src/package
#            ‚Üë searches here, then parent, then parent...
#            ‚Üë finds /home/user/project/workspace/install/setup.bash
